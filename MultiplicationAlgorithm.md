##Algorithm for the Multiplication using Quantum Computers:

#How the Multiplication will return:
#for Classical Multiplication on Classical Computers:
let's say I'd Multiply 2*2, first this 2 in Binary will be 1 0; hence, the multiplication of 1 0 * 1 0 = 1 0 0 which equals 4.

So for the classical multiplications on a QC:
if i have a state |0> and a state |1> multiplied it will reflect |000>
  |1> and a state |1> multiplied will return: |001>
